    subtitle: >
      I am an Associate Professor at [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/u-m-laitenberger),
      and Academic Lead of the Information Systems section. I received my PhD in Business Economics from KU Leuven in 2015.


      I conduct empirical research at the intersection of economics and information systems.
      My research interests include studying how digital markets and platforms operate and how
      competition between and on them takes place. Examples of topics I have looked at include
      the potential biases in recommendation systems, online labor platforms, and reputation mechanisms.


      I have published papers in journals such as *MIS Quarterly*, *Quantitative Marketing and Economics*,
      *Marketing Science*, *American Economic Journal: Microeconomics*, and the *Journal of Industrial Economics*.
